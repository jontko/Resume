    <H3>Managaing a Sales Team by Personality</H3> <br>
    <p>How do we get the most efficient and effective sales team? This question is asked, in one form or another, by most organizations with a sales force. Many factors contribute to a successful sales team. As front-line employees, sales reps are the face of the company to the community and their success means success for the organization. Hiring, training, communication, motivation and compensation are all parts of managing a successful sales team. The least of which is not the manager. A sales manager is a crucial to the health of an organization. And a good manager can take almost anyone with a pulse and turn them into an effective sales person. However, a bad manager can almost certainly hurt not only the sales team, but the organization in general. Managers reading this, are most likely on the good side, as they are continually seeking to make themselves better. This article is not to go over the breadth of management skills and knowledge needed to be successful. This article is focusing on the portion of managing people not related to skill, education or experience. This article focuses on managing an individual according to their personality, for the benefit of the whole organization.

        Before getting into managing to personalities, directly, it is fundamental to know why one would manage to a personality instead of asking the person to change for the job. One could be tempted to think, that given enough motivation and corrective action, any employee can be directed to accommodate to any position. The supposition, that everyone can do anything they put their mind to, a “pull themselves up by their own bootstraps” mentality, is highly inaccurate to what is often seen in the reality of day to day business. This mentality, I will refer to as “bootstrap ideology”.  The truth of the matter is that all people are NOT created equal so a Bootstrap Ideology, only applies to some personalities. Often managers will be directing a team, directing certain behaviors, and even though the entire team is executing the behavior, only some of the team sees the desired results. These result variation, in spite the execution of best practices, can be perplexing and frustrating for management. However, it is beneficial for management to note that personality is not just an attitude choice and is every bit as innated and unchangeable as the employee’s height, color or any physical attribute. We are not all born to be tall, perfect vision and hearing. Some people are born short, some with disabilities, some haver great vision, some can sing, and some cannot sing. No matter how hard they try and put their mind to it, a 7’ tall 300lb man will find it extremely difficult to be a highly competitive professional jokey. That may sound harsh, but it is the reality of the world. Pretending that the world is otherwise, does not help anyone attain their goals. Realizing how things are and planning accordingly is how success is achieved. No matter how hard a person tries, it is almost impossible for someone to act outside of the personality and mental condition they were born with and developed into adulthood.  The famous debate between Nature verses Nurture is now coming to a point where we can draw certain conclusions. A person can change their environment, socioeconomic position and diet, but even if they make all the right decisions, genetics will play a determining, inescapable, role in their lives. We now know that a person’s longevity is partially in their genetics, about 25% [i]. Also, a large portion of a person’s ability to be happy or their inclination to depression is also in their genes[ii]. The IQ a person is born with can only be stretched so far and a great amount of mental illness has less to do with the environment or an individual’s choice, but with what genes they are born with. It is not impossible for someone to succeed despite their genetics, but unless the person is born with certain chromosomes in specific locations, they may not have all the mental, emotional and physical tools to escape how they were born. A person can fit into a position outside of their natural inclining’s, but it is like trying to stretch a metal spring into a pole; the objective of having a straight line will fail, the spring will get bent out of shape and be largely unusable as a spring after the stretching.  It’s better to use the spring as a spring and a metal pole as a pole.
        
        

        With the understanding of the role of a person’s predispositions being roughly immutable, a manager’s best bet at creating a productive team is to select people whose unchangeable predispositions match the job at hand and then construct an environment where they can thrive with minimal internal stress.  The first step to having a successful sales team is to consider personality when hiring. It could even be argued that personality should be considered with higher priority than skill, experience or education.  So, the first step toward having a great sales team, is to build a great sales team, from those naturally inclined to succeed at sales.
        
        Once a team is built, we must also understand proper techniques when interacting with people of different personalities. In an ideal environment you would have all certain personalities in a “hunting” roll, and certain personalities in a “farming” roll, etc., and likewise assist individuals with finding roles that match their innate personality. If you could have a sale tame of homogenous personalities, managing the team would be much easier, as the manager would only have to know how to interact with that one personality type. However, since most managers inherit their team, at least in part, until attrition affords them the opportunity to hire, an effective manager will know how to successfully interact with all personalities. Most people are aware of the big 5 attributes of personality: Openness, Conscientious, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticisms[iii]https://youtu.be/2Zj8K5zKXhM[iv]. Everyone has traces of most of these but are dominant in only one or two of them. Throughout modern psychology, there have been several systems to evaluate these personalities and relay instructions on interpersonal relationship successes. A practical understanding of interpersonal dynamics gives a manager an advantage in leading a successful sales team.
        
        Understanding personality aptitude is of the most acute importance during the hiring process. When a company posts a job, before they get into skills, history, education and references, they need to know what personality fits the position the best. Often, we see managers hire people because they have an education, certifications, skills and experience in the field, not considering their personality at all. Then management can find it extremely difficult to get the employee engaged and productive. Yes, this employee could have history or certifications in an area, but that doesn’t mean they have been happy, and that performance will remain positive in the future. Remember the spring analogy? A great number of people don’t understand what they like to do or what personality they are. The could be applying for jobs they think they would like, not understanding they will not be a fit and will not be happy. Then once they determine a level of dissatisfaction, may be too ingrained to easily change.  For example, someone may love numbers. Their social background could tell them that people who are good at math become accountants. Therefore, they go to school and get an accounting degree and become a CPA. They probably got great grades and are quickly snatched up by an accounting firm. But this person may not have stopped to realize they love talking with people. They want to be outside, have a flexible schedule and be more involved in the amount of money they can make. They want the excitement of an ever-changing environment with some risk involved. They may spend hours day dreaming or trying not to fall asleep at work. Becoming more and more miserable over the years. The individual may count the minutes until they can clock out. They may start making costly mistakes and worse of all, get to a place where they don’t care that they are making mistakes at all. However, if this individual realizes that they are outgoing and extroverted, they may find that they could put their love for math to work in a career in sales, where they would most likely thrive. Skills can be taught; experience will be gained but changing a personality is almost impossible to force. Also, experience is not always preferable, as often new organizations must un-teach past experiences that are not conducive with the new organizations system and culture. The individual in this example, would get passed over for most sales position because of a distinct lack of education, skill and experience, however they would make an amazing sales rep for the company that recognized their personality and could effectively train and manage them.
        
        

        
        How does a company know the personality of applicants? Probably the most widely used workplace personality evaluations are the Meyers Briggs Test Indicator (MBTI)[v]and the DiSC Assessment.[vi]  The MBTI is based on Carl Jung’s 16 core personality types, where the DiSC Assessment is based on William Mouton Marston studies of interpersonal relationship roles. Utilizing both systems in chorus can be optimally effective. The MBTI can be used to understand the employee, and what jobs best fit them while the DISC assessment will enlighten the manager in the best ways to communicate with the employee. MBTI is like the guide on a safari and DiSC is like the translator.  For example, referring to hiring, we know that DiSC results with high “D” and “I” are great in sales, however, results that are majority “S” or “C”, especially “C”, can have a difficult time in sales, but are usually great with analytics. Also, on the MBTI, the ESxx can be great salespeople, but most of your “I” and especially the “INxx” personalities can find sales very difficult and can even be harmful to these individuals but are usually amazing at organization and systems.
        
        Managing people to the advantage of the company, must take the employee and their individual personalities into account, in order to most effectively meet corporate goals. There are two main part to allow any employeesto operate optimally: Hygiene and Motivation.[vii]  Companies and especially mid-level management tend to waste copious amounts of time and money trying to motivate people with little or no avail. Where if money where put into accommodating Hygiene organizations would get more “bang for their buck”, by spending less money to get better results.
        
        First, let’s look at work “hygiene”. This does not referent to how clean people are, or that there is soap in the bathroom.  Hygiene is the basic workplace environment that needs to be in place for an employee to be able to perform their job. The hygiene factor reduces attrition and must be in place before employees can be optimally effective. Good hygiene must be in place before a motivational program can be successfully implemented. The more diverse in personality type the more difficult it becomes to provide full workplace hygiene to all personalities. It would be ultimately effective to have employees of similar personality types working together, even if they are on different teams. At minimally introverts and extroverts should have separate work environments.[viii]
        
        Once a company and team has established a healthy work hygiene, then management can move onto developing a motivational environment. Now, it is important to realize that managers cannot motivate people, a person has to motivate themselves, however managers can orchestrate programs and interpersonal communications that ignite a personals inmate motivation triggers.[ix]Conversely if leadership interacts in a way that is hard for a person’s personality to understand or accept, they will create a de-motivating factor. When an environment doesn’t lean toward motivation, the performance of the team suffers.[x]
        
        

        
        Personality also plays a major role in what type of sales person the individual will excel in. We often are tempted to round sales reps into two categories, hunters and farmers, where the roles of a sales person have at least four types; the Hunter, Farmer, Strategic and Retail sales rep.[xi]Hunters will tend to ignore existing base and actively pursue new logos and new business. Think Cheetah. Farmers are good at taking the existing base and continue to present them with sales opportunities. Strategic reps are not focused on the relationship but on fixing problems for the customer in order to generate new revenue. Strategic reps are like good mechanics. The fix broken things for the customer, therefore garnering loyalty resulting I return business.  Retail reps like rapid turnaround of sales and prefer to sit in one place and allow new business to come to them and then close the sale. Think about a Venus Fly-Trap.
        
        Now on to the pragmatic interaction with a sales force. How does a manager begin? First, you need to determine what each employee’s personality is. Once the manager knows each employee’s personality, they can address current hygiene and work with upper management to ensure the work environment does not hamper the employees and their productivity. Once hygiene has been modified to fit the personalities of the team, make sure you communicate with each personality according to their personality.  For example, dominant extroverts are going to want excitement, goals and marching orders. Think of football players getting excited in the locker room before the game. However, introverted C and S personalities will get shut down by hype and just letting them go. They will want quiet, written and thorough explanations of how and why and the process. Once the hygiene is established and the communication is understood, now management can establish motivational environments that are accommodating to each personality types. Management may not spend the same effort with all employees. Some team members may need more time up front and less down the road. However, some may require continual over site. A great benefit of a solid understanding of employee personalities, is that mangers can plan their time and effort according to the people on their team and reduce ineffective communication.
        
        How to start. First the manager should gain buy in from HR and their hierarchy as to the importance of working according to employee personality instead of the company expecting all employees to fit a pre-set mold. The manager and the immediate organization should then educate themselves in the psychology of hiring and management. Bringing in an Industrial and Organizational Psychologist as a consultant may be a good idea, especially if working with personalities is new to the organization. Once the local organization is on the same page and trained, then managers should gain an understanding of their current work forces personalities. At this point managers should arrange the workforce hygiene to match the various personality types on the team. Motivation will be implemented one on one according to the individual sales person. Once the current team and organization is actively working with the personality of the current team, hiring, taking personality into consideration, should be used moving forward. Managers can then build a team for optimal success according to their personalities.

    <h3>Stimulating Motivation in a Corporate Environment</h3>
    <p>Introduction (Abstract)

        The CEO of a large corporation has a need for change in his company that would create an environment conducive to stimulating change in employees already engaged. Perception of the CEO is that interpersonal conflict is preventing unified participation in the productive achievement of corporate goal. This will explain the value of psychological organization planing and implementation. Also, this paper will describe individual personal factor that affect the productivity of the company, articulate an plan for rectifying the situation and describe the expected outcome of the change plan. This paper will utilize learned theories of organizational change and behavior in order identify individual behavior attributes that have an effect on corporate productivity; Then compose a plan for creating an environment that is stimulating to motivation.
        
        Keywords: CEO – Chief Executive Officer, IOP – Industrial and Organizational Psychology, ROI – Return on Investment
        
        The value of providing Industrial and Organizational Psychological evaluation and planing to affect of positive change on motivation and therefore productivity. Organizations tend to spend large quantities of funds in attempts to change their organization in attempt to meet goals such as shareholder profitability. However, in a large portion of these instances, the efforts of the companies are unsuccessful and organizations see no positive return on investment. What if the decision makers in this organization had a crystal ball to aid them in decision making before funds were committed to change. How would change be best executed to include employee buy in? What if the change could be streamlined so as not to waist resources on the endeavor? Also, what if the stakeholders could be made aware of that, in fact, they are solving the wrong problem, what is called a Type III Error?(Kilmann, 1979) What would leadership pay for such a crystal ball? In fact, I the IOP professional, am that crystal ball. One conundrum modern companies are faced with is that they know they need to modernize and be forward thinking but are still trapped in a stricken Train Wreck business structure, a mentioned by Major George W. Wistler way back in 1841 . (Dahlke, 2016)
        
        

        
        Individual personality and behavior plays a crucial roll in the accomplishment of organizational outcome goals. One of the first things to be considered in approaching a successful change for the CEO in question would be to take into consideration more modern organizational structures that take into account Kurt Lewin’s observations on social psychology as well as other concepts of Behaviorism such as those presented by B.F. Skinner (Dahlke,2016). Since the CEO has the perception of the issue springing from the call center, and providing after discussion and discovery confirming the CEO’s perception we would start with the call centers. The majority of the method of motivation would follow McClellends the Acquired Needs model of motivation. (Brevis, T. and Vrba, M. J., 2015) Utilizing Reid and Ramarajan’s ideas of working in a stressful environment, we would identify various personality types that are at play in the call center. (Reid, E.;Ramarajan, L., 2016). Once the various types of workers are identified I would then star using Kotters eight steps process to change to implement change in the department ( Reid,E; Ramarajan,L., 2016). During this process I would want to ensure we developed an environment of trust. Building this trust will increase commitment to the company and increase productivity, according to Paul Zac. Dr. Zac demonstrates that as trust is formed oxytocin is released. Or rather as oxytocin is released trust is formed. (Paul,2017).
        
        Motivation can not be forced on the employee, but a manager and and a company can create an environment that stimulates motivation (Dahlke,2015). How would this company create an environment that stimulated motivation within its various employees. The first step is establishing, or possibly regaining trust. How does a company develop an environment of trust? First of all employees need to know they can voice opinions without fear of negative repercussions (Paul,2017). By instituting negative reinforcement, by removing the threat of punishment for open communication, we start to increase trust. Furthermore I would divide the larger team into smaller more communal groups. I would look for those who were motivated by leadership and assign them as leaders of the group. Then I would place those who enjoy the social aspect of work in the group and give each of the groups goals such as increased customer service scores, problem resolution and product knowledge. I would make the goals easy to obtain at first and gradually increase the difficulty; in this we increase the confidence that they are good at their jobs (Blanchard, Lacinak, Tompkins & Ballard, 2001). Then I would instruct the team leaders to identify those who like to work by themselves and accomplish set tasks while maintaining autonomy of their work. These more introverted detail oriented individuals would be given tasks to do, given details on how to carry out systems and processes. They would also be given the scope of their work including deadlines. However, we would then allow these individuals almost total control of their schedule, work location, dress, etc.. Dr. Zac would call this Job Crafting. (Zac, P., 2017)
        
        Within these new groups, the group leads would have some basic guidelines. First they would be mentored in quality leadership skills by successful leader from within and without the company. Secondly we would empower these team leaders with system, supplies and support. The team leaders would be instructed to only redirect behavior in private one on one session, but praise employees publicly and as often as possible. The intended outcome of this, would be that leaders would accurately portray company information while building trust. Secondly, the company is training future leaders for better upward mobility.
        
        

        
        Motivational stimulation plan is expected to have results that will meet or exceed the desired outcome of the CEO of the corporation in question. Anecdotally employee usually take about 3 months to get to know what their actual job is, six months to be adapt at their jobs and 12 months to be good at their jobs. It is crucial to prevent attrition of employees prior to this year and throughout the near future. High attrition reduces the actual ROI on staffing investments. For our company we should look to see employees becoming aware that the new structure is an actual operational change and not just an experiment. How long does it take to form trust? Time is a crucial element in preforming a ROI calculation. However, when dealing with humans and considering the human factor, this variable can be just that, variable. It’s interesting because while trust is built by the release of Oxytocin, dopamine is the neurotransmitter released during reward systems. Repeating an activity that releases dopamine can create a craving for this activity. If the activity is repeated continually, the individuals dopamine levels will reduce to regulate the level of dopamine. Then if the behavior is stopped, the individual has an extremely negative reaction. This is the definition of addiction. Why do I bring this up? Companies are not wanting employees that are addicted to their job. Despite the immediate thought that addiction would work, Dr. Zac’s article states the benefits of trust not addiction. Dopamine reactions are virtually instantaneous however, oxytocin takes time to develop the desired outcome. For example oxytocin is generally considered in the context of child bearing and mother hood, as it is the chemical that causes contractions and lactation. Oxytocin released during childbirth and breastfeeding and early childhood rearing are what creates the famous maternal bond. How does this relate to building trust in the business? A company will need to do more than just throw employees treats when they do well. Paul Zac mention eight ways of building trust. (Zac, P. 2017) All of these must be implemented for oxytocin to continue to build in order for trust to be established. These oxytocin releases will be related to experiences. The manager, coworkers and company, must consistently demonstrate experiences that release oxytocin in a way that builds trust. This time can be differently, however I would say, in general, at six months the CEO should start to see a moderate amount of change. At nine. months of consistent corporate behavior the organization should start to see result. After one year, the corporate and employee behaviors have become habitual. This is when the most results would be evident, in my estimation.
        
        A CEO who would retain an IOP professional to enact positive change in his company, would first need to recognize the value of such an individual to his company. Once the CEO understood the validity of an organizational overhaul to achieve success they would be able to move forward. This particular organizations situation would benefit best from McClellends the Acquired Needs model of motivation. (Brevis, T. and Vrba, M. J., 2015). In the process, the call center would benefit from implementing aspects of Reid and Ramarajan’s of working in a stressful environment. (Reid & Ramarajan, 2016). The entire process, however, will need to be built on the foundation of employee trust in their company. (Zac, P., 2017). Implementations of the afore mentioned motivational theories should accomplish the CEO’s goals of increasing productivity, obtaining his concept of change.
        
        

        
        This course, Organizational Theory and Behavior has been crucial to my understanding of Industrial Organizational and Industrial Psychology. Corporate Organization, Planing Change and understanding of individual motivation. For me it is amazing to read over all of the information I have learned during this course, and think that is has only been four weeks. The benefits of this class have exceeded my expectations and have been more applicable than I would probably like. Over the last 3 weeks I have been able to experience organizational changes from a close perspective. My company has gone through a major change. As I read Paul Zac’s paper on trust I kept chuckling and shaking my head, figuratively. When Paul discusses the need for open communication, dispersal of knowledge I tend to scoff (Zac, P. 2017). My company communicated no changes ahead of time which is not historically normal. Previous layoffs have been discussed in quarterly meetings and employees where given plenty of notice. These most recent changes where just sprung on employees without notice. Even three weeks later, there has been no official announcement or discussion with stakeholders about changes, even as they close down every store in West Virginia and San Antonio Texas. Hundreds of employees are being let go with no corporate disclosure. However this course has been a great sense of peace as it has enabled me to understand Verizons organizational structures and management styles, and with understanding comes peace. This course has given me much more knowledge than I anticipated and I am grateful for that.
