    <h4>Well, hello there!</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Welcome to my personal informational page. Most likely, if you are viewing this page, you are considering adding me to your orangizaitons team. There are a lot of questions an organization may have about an individual they are considering hiring, that can not be determined in a traditional resume. To the end of giving you a better understanding of who I am and how I will fit with your organization, I have compiled this site. And if you have come across this page, for reasons other than possibly employing me, I welcome you as well, and hope you enjoy the page.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is important for companies to find the best fit for each position in their organization. The best fit is not only someone who can carry out specific tasks, but someone who is a good fit in the organizations culture. Therefore, this site is designed, to enable you to gain the information about me you might need in determining if I am the best fit for, not only for the position you are looking to fill, but also will be an asset to the groups culture.</p>
